# node-native-io

**node-native-io** contains **sysfs** bindings for **gpio** (and when finally
working **pwm**) in nodejs.

## Installation

Install **node-native-io** with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install node-native-io

## Preview

    var nativeio = require('native-io');

    nativeio.createGPIO(22)
        .direction(nativeio.GPIO.OUT)
            .value(nativeio.GPIO.HIGH)
        ;

## Documentation

Basically **node-native-io** only uses a C++ add-on to sweaten access over
the raw **fs** api.

### pwm

Going to be supported when usage through device tree overlays is possible on
my beaglebone black with archlinux.

### gpio

The **G**eneral **P**urpose **I**nput **O**utput module targets the sysfs api
at `/sys/class/gpio`. 

#### Class: GPIO

On object creation the corresponding GPIO is created, on garbage collection it 
should be unexported.

##### new GPIO(id)

    var gpio = new nativeio.GPIO(22);

    // is equal to

    var gpio = nativeio.createGPIO(22);

Creates new gpio object for pin `id`.

##### gpio.direction([direction])

    if (gpio.direction() === nativeio.GPIO.IN)
        gpio.direction(nativeio.GPIO.OUT);

Returns and sets direction of a GPIO.

##### gpio.value([value])

    if (gpio.value() === nativeio.GPIO.HIGH)
        gpio.value(native.io.GPIO.LOW);

Returns and sets value of a GPIO. If direction is `IN` and you set a new 
`value` you will get an error.
